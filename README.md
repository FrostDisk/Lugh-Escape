# El Escape de Lugh

This is the original source code from the videogame "**El Escape de Lugh**", our first project. 

## About

**El Escape de Lugh** is a puzzle-style videogame inspired on the originals pipe building games. The goal is to help *Lugh*, a woodlouse animal, to reach it's goal before the time runs out. For that, you need to build a road using the generated pieces so Lugh can roll onto them and achieve the target. 

Each level starts with different positions for Lugh and the target and each level the times runs faster than the previous. The game ends when the times runs out and Lugh gets to a dead-end.

## Credits

The code was originally written by [Gonzalo Hidalgo](https://github.com/NioZero) with the help of [Esteban Jeldres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeldres) for Graphics and [Javier √Ålvarez](https://www.instagram.com/jr.musician/) for the Music and Sounds. 

It was developed using using [Irrlicht Engine](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net) and was created initially for a contest in a small game development community.

## Installation

Before trying to compile all the files you'll need to install a few things. 

* [Visual Studio 2013](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) (although theoretically it can run in recent versions but I haven't tested)
* [Audiere](http://audiere.sourceforge.net) (for audio library)
* [DirectX SDK May 2006](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=10368) (used by Irrlicht)

To compile just open the solution file and build it using the default settings. The project doesn't contain the original graphics and sound assets because they are copyrighted but you can use the files from the [official release](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_3NzjaU4D1FSHNscHMwdmREZkE/view?usp=sharing) making a little change in the initialization code.
